This web application is a solution to today’s significant problems: advertisements (ADS). Nowadays, every major company wants to maximize its profits, and the best way to do this is by forcing users to watch long advertisements.

## About VidFlow

This web application is kind of similar to YouTube, so it's a video sharing platform, but with the coolest design and features that only available on this website. You can enjoy your favourite contents from other video sharing platforms, but without annoying ads, with a modern styled background and the most important is that all part of the site is personalized for your thoughts.

_With our site, you can pay all your attention on videos and put all annoying ads in the background!_
 
VidFlow has a modern, simple look. Unlike other video-sharing platforms, the most important component here is the user experience. This app creates a personalized library of videos based on your viewing history, allowing you to create playlists, like videos, and more.

<h3>What would you say, if this app would let you customize colors and fonts?</h3>

Sounds cool, right? :)

Well, we’ve added options for customizing colors and fonts throughout the whole site. We know that everyone loves setting up their own style, so this will be the first video sharing site where you will have the opportunity to choose out the color of fonts, video backgrounds or simply change the font style to a different one.

The best thing in VidFlow is that you don’t have to skip any videos you like, because the platform will contain every single video that you would watch on YouTube.
So this sounds like a YouTube copy, but it is not, although some functions are available in YouTube as  well. This app removes(partly) all ads and makes you a better, more simple way to watch your favourites.
